# pymcfost

This is an attempt to port in python the functions that were available in the yorick-mcfost code.
The goal is to provide a simple and fast way to explore a single or a few model.

A more complete python distribution (in particular dealing with sets of models and model fitting) is available at https://github.com/cpinte/mcfost-python
